# Solana Token Launcher

Solana Token Launcher is a powerful, user-friendly decentralized application (dApp) built using React that enables users to effortlessly create, mint, and manage SPL tokens on the Solana blockchain. It supports real-time wallet integration, authority info fetching, ATA (Associated Token Account) management, and metadata deployment through IPFS via Pinata.
